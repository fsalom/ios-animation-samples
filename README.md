# ANIMATION SAMPLE

## Introduction

This repo contains a bunch of animation sample to try in your projects. 

### Transitions
- Custom transition for present controller. Using `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` you can manipulate the transition between 2 viewcontrollers. In this case we have 2 viewcontrollers (A and B) where A is presenting B but we have change its behaviour to make it different.

Expected behaviour             |  Modified behaviour
